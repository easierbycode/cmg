// The two never talk directly — the Realtime Database sits between them, which
// is why the watch needs no companion app and this page needs no inbound port.
// It is the same arrangement, the same database and the same shape of code as
// shmupX's static/watch-launch.js, which starts games the same way; `music` is
// its own subtree so one code can pair a wrist to both without the two
// stepping on each other's `launch`.
//
// THE WATCH CODE is the pairing: eight characters this page makes up the first
// time the remote is switched on, shown in the Guide, typed once on the watch.
//
// SECURITY. The database is open-read and open-write with no auth, so anything
// arriving here was written by whoever knows the code — which is meant to be
// the owner's watch and might not be. Every field is therefore untrusted:
// `action` is matched against a fixed list, and `album`/`track` are looked up
// in the library the player itself reported rather than passed through. Nothing
// here is eval'd, fetched or navigated to on the strength of what a record
// said. What is published is ids and titles — never a track's URL.
